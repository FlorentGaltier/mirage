MIRAGE - 1.1
=============

This framework is released as an opensource project using the MIT License.

Mirage is a powerful and modular framework dedicated to the security analysis of wireless communications. It currently provides :

  * multiple **lightweight and hackable wireless protocol stacks** (e.g. Bluetooth Low Energy, Enhanced ShockBurst, WiFi, Zigbee ...)
  * multiple **highly customizable offensive modules** (e.g. Man-in-the-Middle, sniffing, jamming, hijacking, cloning ...)
  * mutiple **modules dedicated to information gathering** (e.g. applicative layers dumping, scanning ...)
  * a **chaining operator** allowing to easily combine attack modules in order to **build complex attack workflows**
  * support of **multiple devices**, such as HCI devices, Crazy Radio PA, RZUSBStick, BTLEJack, Nordic and Ubertooth sniffers
  * an **user-friendly development environment** allowing to easily **write new modules** or **customize existing ones**

Publications
------------

This framework is developed in the context of research works focused on IoT security by Romain Cayre, who is a PhD student at LAAS-CNRS and Apsys.Lab. His PhD thesis is supervised by Guillaume Auriol, Vincent Nicomette and Mohamed Kaâniche. 

We published two papers describing this tool:

 * Romain Cayre, Jonathan Roux, Eric Alata, Vincent Nicomette, Guillaume Auriol. [Mirage : un framework offensif pour l'audit du Bluetooth Low Energy](https://hal.laas.fr/hal-02268774). *Symposium sur la Sécurité des Technologies de l'Information et des Communications (SSTIC 2019)*, Jun 2019, Rennes, France. pp.229-258. **\[fr\]**

Man-in-The-Middle firewall additions
------------------------------------

This fork of the main repository contains a Proof-of-Concept for a Man-in-The-Middle based Bluetooth Low Energy firewall, as presented in the demo session of WiSec 2021.

More details about the additions can be found in [FIREWALL.md](FIREWALL.md).
